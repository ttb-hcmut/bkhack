# Multi-page bundling

Web applications adopt one of these paradigms:

- Multi-page application (MPA)
- Single-page application (SPA)

BKHack adopts a hybrid paradigm. At its core, it's MPA. But within a webpage there can be some "subpages", "subviews", which don't require a request to server to navigate to.

The adoption of this paradigm has been somewhat troublesome. Most build tools support either MPA or SPA, not inbetween. For example, the Webpack bundler accepts a JavaScript entry point and outputs a single main bundle file intended for the entire website: this is SPA; so is the Webpack dev-server. Our build system involves in-house OCaml programming plus some hacking of Webpack: specifically, we spawn multiple Webpack instances to make multiple JS bundles corresponding to each route; and we abandon Webpack dev-server altogether in favor of our custom dev-server built on top of live-server.

# Icon graphics, and how the website renders

There are two encodings[^jfp]:

1. The initial encoding. Prefer textual elements
2. The final encoding. Prefer graphical elements

For example, (TBA)

[^jfp]: totally has nothing to do with initial vs. final encoding from theory of algebraic specification
