# Identity is important

Wording has to be precise

There is no _leader_, everyone must be able to consistently articulate what the final goal is.

# Case study: EnvironmentalWeb

Vague statements (chatgpt?)

Bao says: it's a _selfhosted_ Jupyter Notebook for _experts_

Thu says: it's an _online_ weather database browser for _everyone_

Duc says: it's a client-server app

# Case study: Valve

A repository of tasks

Anyone can pick a task to work on by themselves

(specifically, "pick task" here is Switching to a chair)

Very high discipline or motivation

As long as you have fun!

As long as you don't change midway - take responsibility!

Bao, since he first pitched this whole platform idea (first-mover privilege)

# FAQ

Q: "I want to do X Y Z but you know more than I do so ehh you should do it"

Try something new and fun!
