# Writing styles

Our philosophy is that each programmer should have a signature style of writing, we celebrate differences and believe that we can learn from each other to become better code writers and readers.

> [!NOTE] Elsewhere this culture will be discouraged due to maintenance complexity, however our team is small (~3 people at a time) and doesn't grow and we keep a close social social, so for us it's fine.

Even so, for sane development, we do establish some bare-minimum common grounds:

- Indentation is 2-space-wide tab
- TBA

And as our styles are different we have the responsibility to document what each style is and take the initiative to fix and refactor when necessary.

> [!NOTE] Also, we don't prevent anyone from modifying each other's code, but it is discouraged.

## Khang

A module is read as a namespace declaration. Module name is pascal case.

```reason
module ItemNav{

}
```

Pipe operators are treated as member accessors. The most common example is pipe first `->`, which looks like the pointer-based member accessor operator from C++. This is also applicable to pipe last `|>` as well.

```reason
let getIt = raw => {
    let el = raw->Date.Utc.date->string_of_int;
    ...
}
```

Indeed, it appears as if `Date.Utc.date` is a member "method" of `raw`. Functions like `string_of_int` does break that suspension of disbelief. Indeed, this is also reminiscent of record field syntax where if the record type belongs in a module then you can prepend the module path immediately before the field accessor but after the record value to make it immediately available.

When used like this, pipe operators don't have surrounding spaces. In other words, they are immediate between operands, and are used as connectives.

## Kinten

A module is read as an equation, where the right side is the definition. Module name is snake case, with heavy use of underscore as part separator, and prime notation to connect definitions together (see below).

```reason
module Item__nav = {

}

module Item__nav' = {
    include Item__nav
}
```

Prime notation can denote:
